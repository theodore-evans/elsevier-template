\begin{abstract} 
The spread of the use of artificial intelligence techniques is now pervasive and unstoppable. However, it brings with its opportunities but also risks and problems that must be addressed in order not to compromise an effective evolution. The eXplainable AI (XAI) is one of the answers to these problems to bring humans closer to machines.
While from a research perspective the discussions on XAI date back a few decades, the concept emerged with renewed vigour at the end of 2019 when Google, after announcing its "AI-first" strategy in 2017, recently announced a new XAI toolset for developers. Nowadays many of the machine and deep learning applications do not allow you to understand how they work entirely or the logic behind them for effect called "BlackBox", according to which machine learning models are mostly black boxes. This feature is considered one of the biggest problems in the application of AI techniques; it makes machine decisions not transparent and often incomprehensible even to the eyes of experts or developers themselves. Explainable AI systems can explain the logic of decisions, characterize the strengths and weaknesses of decision making, and provide insights into their future behaviour.
